# Learning about Version Control
## author: Edward Sobczak
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like most that version control makes it very easy to see what has changed from previous versions of the code. This makes me feel better about deleting blocks of code that I think are unnecessary now, but that might be useful later.

I find some of the steps of merging conflicts to be confusing because I feel like I'm doing things without any purpose. It's also frustrating when the suggestions that Git provides in the error message aren't the correct suggestion, like for rebasing.
